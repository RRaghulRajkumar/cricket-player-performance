# Cricket Player Performance Prediction using Machine Learning
## Overview
Welcome to the "Cricket Player Performance Prediction" project! This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for predicting the performance of cricket players using machine learning techniques. The project aims to leverage historical player data and relevant features to build predictive models that can estimate the performance of players in future matches.

## Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict the performance of cricket players in upcoming matches. The prediction can be based on various player attributes, historical performance, playing conditions, opponent strength, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical player statistics from various cricket matches, including batting averages, bowling averages, strike rates, number of centuries, wickets taken, etc. The dataset may also include details about the playing conditions, team performance, and opponent team's performance.

## Goals
The key goals of this project are as follows:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather historical player data from reliable sources, clean the dataset, and handle any missing or erroneous values.
Feature Engineering: Identify relevant features and create new features to represent player performance attributes effectively.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform data exploration to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and key performance indicators of players.
Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression or classification tasks based on the prediction requirements.
Model Training: Train the selected machine learning models on the prepared dataset to learn patterns and relationships between player attributes and performance.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using suitable metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model hyperparameters and explore ensemble techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
Prediction and Deployment: Use the trained models to make predictions on new data and deploy the models for real-time performance estimation.

Usage
To predict cricket player performance using machine learning, you will need Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:

## bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the required libraries, you can use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to preprocess the data, explore player statistics, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
